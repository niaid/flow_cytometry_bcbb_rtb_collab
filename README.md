## flow_cytometry_bcbb_rtb_collab

### Aim
Generate a container, that can perform operations such as Quality Control on `fcs` files.
Once created, this container can be provided to third parties to do analysis.

### Usage
The container should be able to accept arguments such as an input_dir, and an output_dir, along with the type of QC analysis to be performed? (eg FlowAI). https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/bioc/html/flowAI.html

Initially only FlowAI will be implemented.
